### Prepared for Google Developer Students Clubs - Build ML Portfolio Series.  NLP Workshop Presented in May 2023

Author: Noble A.

Learn the exciting and cutting-edge field of natural language processing (NLP) and its applications on Google Cloud Platform. Join our workshop series for students and entry-level developers, and leave with a working project and a foundation to continue improving it. Get inspired by peers and professionals who will share project ideas to help you stand out during the hiring process. 

Today we’re going to learn about Natural Language Processing. NLP is technology that teaches machines to understand human languages. 
Specifically…we will learn how to use an NLP model to teach a machine to recognize when a human shares potentially sensitive information in a consumer or enterprise system.

**Remember to reference spaCy docs to take advantage of .spacy and doc object etc.**

I ran this workshop using a traditional ML approach to:

*  Give you some foundations on natural language processing, specifically in this case Named Entity Recognition;
*  Familiarize yourself with real world use cases of natural language processing and understanding; 
*  This is not a GenAI talk but going through these fundamentals will help you better understand terms and techniques used in large language models today;  and then finally as a bonus
*  You can build your machine learning portfolio along the way.
